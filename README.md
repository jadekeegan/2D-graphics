# 2D Graphics
This repository contains implementation for a 2D graphics engine created in UNC's COMP 475 2D Graphics course under the guidance of Mike Reed.

This engine contains support for drawing convex polygons, non-convex polygons (using winding principles), stroked lines, and meshes. For shapes/images created, the engine also allows for various shaders to be applied, such as a linear gradient, radial gradient, texture (image), etc. These shaders support different "out of bounds" behavior (clamping, mirroring, and repeating).

Pre-implemented images may be viewed by running `./image` in the terminal.
